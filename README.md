1. Segment customers based on purchasing patterns using RFM methodology
2. Identify high-value customers and at-risk customers
3. Calculate customer lifetime value across segments
4. Provide actionable recommendations for each customer segment
5. Create an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders

## 📊 Dataset Information

**Source:** [Online Retail Dataset - UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle]

**Dataset Description:**
- **Time Period:** 2 years of transactional data
- **Records:** 500,000+ transactions
- **Customers:** 4,000+ unique customers
- **Geography:** Multiple countries across continents

**Key Tables:**
- `Customers` - Customer demographic information
- `Orders` - Transaction-level data
- `OrderDetails` - Product-level order information

---

## 🔍 Methodology

### RFM Analysis Framework

**Recency (R):** How recently did the customer make a purchase?
- Measured in days since last purchase
- Lower values = Better (more recent)

**Frequency (F):** How often does the customer purchase?
- Total number of transactions
- Higher values = Better (more frequent)

**Monetary (M):** How much does the customer spend?
- Total spending amount
- Higher values = Better (higher value)

### Scoring System
Each customer receives a score of 1-5 for R, F, and M metrics using quintile distribution:
- **Score 5:** Top 20% (Best)
- **Score 4:** Next 20%
- **Score 3:** Middle 20%
- **Score 2:** Next 20%
- **Score 1:** Bottom 20% (Needs improvement)

## 👥 Customer Segments Identified

| Segment | Description | Marketing Strategy |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Champions** | Best customers - buy frequently, recently, and spend the most | Reward loyalty, early access to products |
| **Loyal Customers** | High frequency and monetary value | Upsell higher value products |
| **Potential Loyalists** | Recent customers with good potential | Nurture with personalized offers |
| **Recent Customers** | New customers who just started buying | Focus on engagement and education |
| **Promising** | Recent shoppers with room to grow | Build relationship, offer incentives |
| **Need Attention** | Above average but declining engagement | Limited time offers, reactivation |
| **About to Sleep** | Below average, risk of becoming inactive | Win-back campaigns |
| **At Risk** | Made big purchases but long ago | Aggressive retention campaigns |
| **Cannot Lose Them** | High value customers who've gone cold | Dedicated account management |
| **Hibernating** | Low frequency, long time since purchase | Re-engagement or survey |
| **Lost** | Lowest engagement across all metrics | Win-back or remove from active marketing |

## 🔑 SQL Highlights

**Key Techniques Demonstrated:**
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for complex queries
- Window Functions (NTILE, ROW_NUMBER, PARTITION BY)
- Advanced CASE statements for segmentation logic
- Date functions (DATEDIFF) for recency calculation
- Aggregate functions with GROUP BY
- Subqueries and joins across multiple tables

**Sample Query - RFM Score Assignment:**
```sql
WITH RFM_Calculation AS (
    SELECT 
        CustomerID,
        DATEDIFF(DAY, MAX(OrderDate), GETDATE()) AS Recency,
        COUNT(DISTINCT OrderID) AS Frequency,
        SUM(TotalAmount) AS Monetary
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY CustomerID
)
SELECT 
    *,
    NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY Recency DESC) AS R_Score,
    NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY Frequency ASC) AS F_Score,
    NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY Monetary ASC) AS M_Score
FROM RFM_Calculation;
```

---

## 📐 DAX Measures Created

```dax
Total Revenue = SUM(Orders[TotalAmount])

Active Customers = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[CustomerID]),
    Orders[OrderDate] >= TODAY() - 90
)

Customer LTV = 
SUMX(
    VALUES(Customers[CustomerID]),
    CALCULATE(SUM(Orders[TotalAmount]))
)

Churn Risk Count = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(Customers[CustomerID]),
    Customers[Customer_Segment] IN {"At Risk", "Cannot Lose Them"}
)
```
